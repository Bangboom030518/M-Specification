One of the main advantages of M is its rich and complex type system, allowing developers to define types

## Primitives

Their are a number of primitives available in M. These are the most basic types, upon which more complex types are formed. [See More](/types/primitives)

## Complex Types:

Complex types allow the developer to create more specific or complicated types. M supports the following complex types:

- [Constraints](/types/constraints)
- [Unions](/types/unions)
- [Structs](/types/constraints)
- [Enums](/types/enums)
