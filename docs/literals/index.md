> **TODO**: "A single unicode codepoint."?

Literals are used to initialise the most basic structs in a reasonably concise and efficient way. There are fewer than in some other languages, but the developer should become extremely familiar with them.

- [char](/char):
  A single unicode codepoint.
- [string](/string):
  A string of chars.
- [number](/number):
  A number, of any type.
- [list](/list):
  A list of values.
- [nil](/nil):
  A lack of value.
