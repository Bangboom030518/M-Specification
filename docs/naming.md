## Notes:

- All variables should be written in `snake_case`.
- Structs and other types should be written in `PascalCase`.
- Acronyms should be written in capitals, e.g `HTTP` or `IO`.
- Namespaces should be written in `PascalCase`.
> TODO: ?
- A pure function that is converting a single value should be prefixed with `to_`, e.g `to_lower_case`.
- Terms in an enum should be written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
